# Machine Learning Practical Assignments

This repository contains all the practical assignments (TDs) completed as part of my machine learning courses. It includes hands-on exercises that cover a wide range of fundamental concepts and techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning, such as:

- **Data Preprocessing**: normalization, standardization, handling missing values.
- **Regression**: linear regression, performance evaluation (MSE, RÂ²).
- **Classification**: logistic regression, confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **Pipelines and Automation**: building reproducible workflows with `scikit-learn`.
- **Clustering**: k-means, PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Model Optimization**: cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning.

Each folder or notebook includes detailed explanations and visualizations to help understand the concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: datasets used for the exercises.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks organized by topic or assignment.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automating specific tasks.
- **docs/**: documentation or theoretical summaries of key concepts.

## Purpose

This repository serves to document my learning journey in machine learning and provide a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore these concepts.
